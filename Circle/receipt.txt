Discussion:

Since the general equation of a circle is: x^2+y^2+Dx+Ey+F=0(D,E,F are numbers)
We can replace x,y in the equation with (x1,y1) or (x2,y2) or (x3,y3)
In this way, we can work out the value of D,E,F
Then we can know the whole equation
According to the formula, Radius=1/2*(D^2+E^2-4F)^1/2
the coordinates of center=(-D/2,-E/2)
